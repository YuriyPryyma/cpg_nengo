In this chapter, we describe the nature of CPG data and its main characteristics. We are using these characteristics to generate synthetic data for training and validation. Below we provide a description of CPG data properties that helps to understand the main research questions.
 
\section{Locomotion phases}

Animal locomotion often described in terms of the gait cycle. A GC starts when a limb contacts the ground and ends when the same limb touches the ground next time. GC is usually broken into two stages: stance and swing. During a stance period, a limb is touching the ground as the opposite during swing phase limb is in the air. A swing phase distinguished from a stance phase when the last toes come off the ground. The intersection of swing phases for two limbs corresponds to running.
